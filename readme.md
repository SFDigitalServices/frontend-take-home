# SFDS - Front-End Take-Home Assignment

Please read all of the instructions before getting started!

### The exercise

We’d like you to convert a mockup into a fully responsive web page.

At a minimum, the page should support:

- Viewport widths between 320px and 1500px. (You’ll have to decide how to adapt the design to fit smaller screen sizes.)

- Firefox, Chrome, and Microsoft Edge. (If you have a Mac, you can test Edge with a [free Browserstack account.](https://www.browserstack.com/test-on-microsoft-edge-browser#))

If you're applying for an engineer or developer position, we've also provided a JSON file for you to populate the data in the "How long does the fellowship last?" table. (If you're applying for a designer position, feel free to ignore it.)

Please share your code via a publicly accessible Git repository, and try to regularly commit to the repo like you would in a real software project.

Feel free to use whatever frameworks, tools, and libraries you are most productive and comfortable with.

### Where's the mockup?

This repo contains a `.fig` file, which you can drag and drop into the free design app Figma. Download the [free desktop app](https://www.figma.com/downloads/) to view it. You can also use the mockup to copy color and size values.

If you're not a designer and are having trouble using Figma, let us know and we can give you a short walkthrough.

### What happens after I’m done?

We’ll schedule a 30–minute call or in-person session where we’ll walk through the code you’ve submitted. We’ll also discuss the types of improvements you might make going forward, if this were a real project.

We’re not evaluating your presentation skills in this call. Rather, this is an opportunity for us to better understand the thought process behind your work, and thus assess it more accurately.

### How long should this take? 

Please spend a maximum of 4 hours on this exercise.

If you’re unable to commit that much time, that's OK! Spend as much time as you can, submit what you have, and let us know how long you worked on it.

If you reach 4 hours and don’t have anything presentable, please contact us and we'll help you decide what to do next.

### What’s in this repo?

- The page’s raw content
  * images in `/images`
  * text in `content.md`

- A boilerplate HTML file to get you started. (Feel free to modify or remove whatever you’d like.)

### How your work will be evaluated

When thinking about how to prioritize your time, try to strike a balance between all five of these metrics, instead of focusing on one (e.g. spending all of your time matching the mockup exactly.)

- **Readability.** Your code and Git commits should be organized in a way that’s easy for others to read and contribute to. For example, CSS class names should also be easy to understand.

- **Maintainability.** Your work should either be composed of reusable components or built with a component-centric mindset. It should avoid “magic numbers” or one-off exceptions. In other words, it should be easy for someone to make changes to one area of the page, or build new pages based on this design, without introducing a bug elsewhere.

- **Accessibility.** Your markup should be semantic, valid, and easy for assistive technologies to parse. Newer HTML / CSS / JS standards should gracefully degrade in older browsers.

- **Visual fidelity.** You don’t need to achieve pixel perfection, but your code should roughly match the mockup (and not display a blank page) across all supported browsers and screen sizes.

- **Performance.** We’ll check to make sure you’re not using any egregiously large or unused assets.
